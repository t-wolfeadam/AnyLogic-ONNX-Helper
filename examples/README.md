# Examples

This folder contains some simple examples that utilize the ONNX Helper Library for AnyLogic. They all require you to have the latest version of AnyLogic installed and the library included in your development environment.

The models in the "Basic" folder are simple demonstrations of the library which are either exceedingly simple toy models or ones trained based on common datasets. The models in the "Standard" folder are more practical examples which expect you to be familiar with the basics of navigating an AnyLogic model. See the README within each folder for more information about the models.

Many examples also include a "python" directory which has the code that was used to generate the ONNX files (provided purely as reference). The descriptions below explain further about the provided scripts and their individual requirements.

If you would like to visualize any of the ONNX files provided, check out: https://netron.app/.
